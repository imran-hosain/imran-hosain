# üëã Hi, I'm Imran Hosain  

## üßë‚Äçüíª About Me:
I‚Äôm a Front-End & WordPress Developer passionate about crafting clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites.
I specialize in turning modern UI concepts into interactive experiences using HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, jQuery, and JavaScript.
On the backend, I work with PHP and MySQL, and I build dynamic, fully-customized WordPress themes that balance design and performance.
I love bridging the gap between design and development, ensuring every interface I build feels intuitive, fast, and visually polished.
